Now that my poor attempt at spelling "TEXT G" in ascii
art is behind us, welcome to this project!

**what is this?**
This is a side project, nothing serious, nothing big.

**how is this?**
I am making this game primarly in C & C++ from scratch
with no helper libraries other than what is provided
in c++11 std lib.

**what is this? (part 2)**
This is a text based game played in the teminal.

You start your jurney by picking your class:
- goblin (melee)
- gnome  (ranged)
- imp    (mage)

Does this choice change much in this game? yes actually:)
- goblins have +attack +armour -stamina
- gnomes have  -attack +armour +stamina
- imps have    +attack -armour +stamina

Once your character has been picked, it is time to battle!
Increasing in difficulty, the battle encounters are enless
(within a reason..), and randomly generated from a template

Every defeated enemy means coins for you, spend those coins
in the shop to get new gear or potions to keep your
playthrough going.

Every playthough ends eventiually, and who knows, maybe if
you score well enough you may find some surprises to aid
your future games?
